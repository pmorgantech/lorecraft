# Implementation Status

This checklist tracks implementation progress against `docs/architecture.md` phases.
The architecture overview remains the design reference; this file is the working status tracker.

**See [`roadmap.md`](roadmap.md) for the detailed sprint-by-sprint breakdown (Sprints 1–23).**

> **Current focus (2026-07-02):** Foundation-first. The `CODE_AUDIT.md` findings drive
> Sprints 5–15 (errors, types, tests, decomposition, service consistency, extensibility
> seams, tooling). Sprints 5–6 complete (error handling, type safety); Sprint 7
> (web/admin characterization tests) in progress. Combat/trading/PvP are gated behind
> the roadmap's foundation exit criteria — no feature expansion until the core is sound.

## Phase-to-Sprint Mapping

- `[ ]` Not implemented.

## 0.1.0 Status

### Project Layout

- [x] Python package uses `src/lorecraft`.
- [x] pytest is configured to import from `src`.
- [x] Unit, integration, and simulation test directories exist.
- [x] `make test` runs the focused test suite.
- [x] Package version is synchronized in `pyproject.toml` and `src/lorecraft/__init__.py`.
- [x] `CHANGELOG.md` exists and includes the current release entry.
- [x] Graphify wired into the workflow: `make install-hooks` now installs a real `.githooks/post-commit` hook, and a Claude Code `SessionStart` hook (`.claude/hooks/session-start.sh`) refreshes `graphify-out/graph.json`. Both no-op cleanly (exit 0) when the `graphify` binary isn't installed locally.

### Phase 1 — Foundation

- [x] `config.py` contains environment-driven settings (including `LORECRAFT_WORLD_YAML_PATH` and dev player seed vars).
- [x] `models/` SQLModel table definitions.
- [x] `create_tables()` startup database initialization.
- [x] `repos/` data access wrappers.
- [x] `game/context.py` contains `GameContext`.
- [x] `game/transaction.py` contains `TransactionContext`.
- [x] `game/connection_manager.py` contains the WebSocket-style connection pool and room broadcast behavior.

### Web UI (HTMX)

- [x] Jinja2 + HTMX + Alpine server-driven frontend integrated as primary UI (`/lobby`, `/game`, `/command`, partials).
- [x] Command flow with immediate HTML response + OOB + WS push for other players.
- [x] Audit log used as source for narrative feed.
- [x] HTMX `POST /command` executes via `CommandEngine` (movement, inventory, dialogue, quest OOB updates).
- [~] Multi-player live lists use `ConnectionManager.is_connected()` and `players_in_room()` when WS connected; world clock SSR + WS `time_update` handler added; full clock push from server events still evolving.
- [x] `game/events.py` contains `GameEvent` and synchronous `EventBus`.
- [x] `main.py` FastAPI app.
- [x] `/ws` WebSocket endpoint.
- [x] Startup/shutdown lifecycle wiring.
- [x] WebSocket connect/send/receive integration test.

### Player Identity & Session Safety (Sprint A)

- [x] `web/player_auth.py` — signed JWT player session cookie (`lorecraft_session`, httponly, `samesite=lax`), reusing `admin/auth.py` token primitives with a separate secret and `token_type="player"` so it can never be replayed as an admin token.
- [x] `Settings.player_session_secret` — auto-generated and persisted to `.env` on first real server startup via `config.ensure_persisted_secret()`; ephemeral per-process fallback for tests/router-standalone use (never writes to disk).
- [x] `get_current_player()` prefers the signed cookie; legacy `?player_id=`/unsigned-cookie dev path retained behind `Settings.allow_query_player_id` (default on).
- [x] `POST /lobby/create` — validated username (3-30 chars, `[A-Za-z0-9_-]`), uniqueness check, creates `Player` at `seed_player_start_room`, auto-login.
- [x] `POST /lobby/enter` — verifies the player exists before minting a session; both lobby routes redirect to plain `/game` (no `player_id` in the URL).
- [x] Lobby UI "Create New Character" tab wired to a real form.
- [~] Not a full account system: no password/credential check on `/lobby/enter`, and `/ws?player_id=...` still trusts the raw query param independent of the signed cookie. See backlog in `docs/roadmap.md`.

### Phase 2 — Command Dispatch

- [x] `game/parser.py` converts raw text into `ParsedCommand`.
- [x] Parser supports direction aliases such as `n` to `go north`.
- [x] Parser strips simple articles from nouns.
- [x] `game/registry.py` supports command registration and aliases.
- [~] `game/registry.py` evaluates a first pass of command conditions.
- [x] `game/rules.py` contains `RuleEngine` with ordered rule checks.
- [x] `game/engine.py` contains command dispatch with state commit, audit, and event-flush lifecycle steps.
- [~] Full 13-step transaction/event/audit lifecycle in `handle_command()`.
- [x] Blocked command audit events.
- [x] `commands/meta.py` with `help` (context-aware: dialogue/combat/`disabled_commands`) and `quit`.
- [x] `commands/movement.py` with `go`, cardinal directions, `unlock`/`lock` (persist `Exit.locked`).
- [x] `services/movement.py` with `MovementService`.
- [x] End-to-end movement test with persistent room change.
- [x] Item `aliases` (YAML/model/loader) for parser fuzzy resolution and `ItemRepo` search.
- [x] `use <item> [on/with <other>]` + `InventoryService.use_item()`, wiring `Item.usable_with`.
- [x] `give <item> to <name>` + `InventoryService.give_item()` for NPC hand-offs.

- [~] Admin WebSocket integration tests — Not yet covered; WS endpoint wired and manually tested via web panel.

### Phase 7 — Frontend Polish

- [x] Admin login box visibility fixed (inline `display:flex` no longer fights CSS class toggle — JS controls display directly).
- [x] Admin panel full-height layout (`height:100vh; display:flex; flex-direction:column`) — no viewport scroll needed.
- [x] Admin tab routing hardened (data-tab attributes, `classList.toggle` — no `event.target` fragility).
- [x] Admin login: Enter-key support on username/password inputs.
- [x] Admin WS live indicator (● ws dot turns phosphor green when connected).
- [x] Admin TUI black screen fixed (`pop_screen` → `push_screen("players")` after login).
- [x] Admin TUI login centering fixed (`LoginScreen { align: center middle; }` CSS rule).
- [x] Admin TUI `import urllib.parse` moved to module top.
- [x] Minimap section `overflow-hidden` added — child borders no longer bleed through rounded corners.
- [x] `quit` command now closes the WebSocket (`disconnect: true` update handled in `app.js`).
- [x] Disconnect button added — appears when connected, hides when offline.
- [x] Player ID input disabled while connected (prevents mid-session reconnect confusion).
- [x] HTMX `POST /command` executes via `CommandEngine`; dialogue overlay and quest tracker ported from vanilla client.
- [ ] Full-screen map modal.
- [ ] Responsive behavior improvements.
- [ ] Browser end-to-end testing.

### Phase 8 — Combat

- [x] Combat models.
- [x] Player stats model.
- [x] `services/scheduler.py` — DB-backed `ScheduledJob` table; `SchedulerService.schedule()`/`cancel()`; dispatches due jobs as `GameEvent.SCHEDULED_JOB_DUE` on every `TIME_ADVANCED` tick. The scheduling primitive combat (and NPC/world delayed effects) will run on.
